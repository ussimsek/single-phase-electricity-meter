# single-phase-electricity-meter

The purpose of this work is to design a digital active single-phase power meter using the 18 series PIC microcontroller.

In this study 18F4620 was used as 18 series PIC. The software is in CCS C language.
The thesis includes the development of the single-phase digital active electricity meter and the design of a single-phase digital active electricity meter.
